Strawlab example analysis
=========================

Just clone and install with pip; read and run *strawlab_examples/euroscipy/euroscipy_example.py*,
which will download a sample dataset (1.7GB) and perform some analysis.

Note that for running the full benchmarks you would need datasets that are unreleased yet.
Use the public dataset (neuropeptide degradation) to get a feeling on how these work.
