Strawlab example analysis
=========================

These are some data anlysis examples and benchmarks over data from the strawlab_.

Just clone and install with pip; read and run *strawlab_examples/euroscipy/euroscipy_example.py*,
which will download a sample dataset_ (1.7GB) and perform some analysis, leveraging amongst
others whatami_ and jagged_.

Note that for running the full benchmarks you would need datasets that are unreleased yet.
Use the public dataset_ (neuropeptide degradation) to get a feeling on how these work.
